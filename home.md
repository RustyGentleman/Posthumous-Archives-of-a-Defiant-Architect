# Posthumous Archives\nof a Defiant Architect

tac_Not even in death I can rest, huh?_

This is, in small part, a fuck-you to the world and to time. I was brought to life and kept in it with complete disregard for my will, and forced to accept that leaving in my own terms would have consequences for those I love. So here it is: I hereby declare myself, in some way, deceased. Fuck you.

In a much bigger part, however, this is meant to be a posthumously developed archive of much that had, in life, kept me from leaving it. Creative projects, musings, ideas; little pieces of my consciousness that I'd like to leave here. To imprint upon you. Yes, my hope is that, in some way, a part of me will still be alive, like some sort of zombie, in the minds of you, both singular and plural.

Not just a worldbuilding and writing project, but an entire world I've built inside my head; the apex of my desire and drive to _create_.

##> Games

Games and/or _game-like_ things I've developed; mostly small in scale.

##> Experiments

Some weird little projects, mostly just for experience and proof of concepts.

Would-be letters to those whose existences I've touched in some manner.
