# _Dying Thoughts_

tac_A few last words, as it were._

To start, whoever you are... I'm a complicated person, for better and worse. If you've had the chance to know me in life, you probably know me to be quite odd, as well. I never learned quite right how to be human. Never quite learned how to properly earn my place in society as it exists. I hope one day it is more... fitting, and welcoming, to those like me.

I might've slighted you a few times; might've said things that seemed mean or touched a tender area within you I couldn't see. And if I have, I apologize, for whatever that's worth. It is seldom my intention to hurt others, though I know my banter and teasing often can.

I humbly ask that you, if not forgive me, at least understand that.

## _To the distant observer_ {#observer}

This is to those who... didn't quite ever know me. Maybe you've talked to me, or heard about me from someone (unlikely), or you've just... seen me around, somewhere (even _less_ likely). This is... well, awkward; I'm not sure how you got here. Do feel free to leave, if you ever feel inclined; this is only an archive, a library.

But _**if**_ you're curious... well, this should give you some deeper perspective on what you might've seen, heard or gleaned from what little ..._social_ interaction we've had. Perhaps you'll find something at least interesting here - if I may **dare** be so optimistic, perhaps you'll _even_ feel inspired by my works, my thoughts, my... my everything that I've placed here. And carry some of it with you, in what you may create yourself.

## _To the acquaintance and the chance encounter_ {#acquaintance}

You must've known me at least somewhat; probably seen some of... _this_, even if you mightn't've realized. Triple contractions are neat, aren't they?

These are, I believe, where I begin to let myself just _be_. A still somewhat curated version of me; limited in scope, but still very real. Perhaps we shared a few interests. Perhaps you were just... nice to me, in a way that I appreciate. But whatever the case, know this: there's a small window on the walls of my mind shaped just for you to look through.

I hope you still enjoy the things you did, and are still doing the things you were. You're probably depressed, or some other flavor of broken - a kind of kinship we likely felt. Whatever it was, I hope you're bettter now. If you are, fuck you. And if you aren't, I'm sorry I'm no longer here to offer some well-placed insights and pointers. Please make the best of what you have and what you are, mm?

## _To the lives I've touched_ {#touched}

This is probably where it starts to get a little heavy. I understand how this looks, and how _somber_ and _morbid_ this whole thing is, but are you truly surprised? If you are one of the addressees to this metaphorical letter, __you've seen__ me casually comment about depression, maybe even suicide; __you've likely heard__ some of my musings on time, existence and meaning.

tac_You know my hunger._

We've probably had longer conversations about shared interests - maybe not-shared interests, too (I'm sorry I'm so bad at conversation). And I want you to know, I **always** appreciated these. You know how gladly I'll go on and on about something so incredibly niche and so incredibly fascinating to me and boring to others. But you may not know, or at least not fully, how happy I am to dip my head into things that, to me, aren't primary interests, and, if they're interests at all, take a _big old whiff_. My life consisted muchly of moments like these and others, and then... spaces between them.

Well, then this is... a thank you. A thank you for tolerating, maybe even enjoying these oddities now contained here - and those kept out of it - and the moments they created. This is something for you to remember me by.

tacRemember me; bye.

## _To... you_ {#you}

Yes, this is _cryptic_, but it's also _self-evident_. You __know__ who you are. And if you don't, __I didn't do a good enough job as a friend__. You were special to me, and you should know why.

We might've not talked in a long time, even though I'd _probably_ thought about you more than once in that time. And if that's the case, I  tell you this: I wish I'd _tried harder_ to be with you. It's intimidating, you know? I **know** what you were like then; I **loved** that person, and that person is still alive in my memories, but I'm sure you're now different in ways __you__ don't even notice. What if we didn't jell anymore? What if... I missed that person, and they no longer existed? What if _you_ didn't like who I was now?

On the other hand, if you still were in my life... **thank you**. I'm sure it wasn't through lack of effort on your part. I didn't have childhood friends, you know? And I didn't really have teenagehood friends, either, other than healthcare professionals - which is rather depressing to think about. So I deeply, genuinely appreciate you having stuck around with me that long. So, again... thank you.

tac>>And fuck you.<<

# __A request for privacy__

If by this point you're no longer sure if I might address you specifically, I ask that you leave this here. I understand that you may be curious, and if you're terribly so, it's okay, I won't resent you - I can't, I won't know; but I wouldn't if I did. It's only that the _nature_ of the following letters is a good deal more personal, so I feel I should ask you to consider whether I'd mind you reading them. Unless you don't know me - then I doln't quite care, I suppose.

tacYou may err on the side of curiosity. I trust your judgement.

## _To a certain spring boy_

You're probably the one I think of the most. **You were an angel** to me. And I can't help but feel as though I've failed you, having lost contact with you so many times. Did you know I looked into hiring a private investigator to look for you? That's how I learned there are many ways to write your name.

I hope you're still alive, somewhere, and I hope you're doing well. If you aren't, I hope you'll think of me every now and then and feel a warmth welling up in your chest. I hope you're still doing art, and still being your adorable self.

tacYou deserve happy life.

tac>>...Please talk to me.<<
