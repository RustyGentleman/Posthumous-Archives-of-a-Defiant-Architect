# _Ras Silverleaf\nand the world of\nYet Unnamed_

[[Live](https://rassilverleaf.tumblr.com)] [[Dev](https://rustygentleman.github.io/Worldbuilding/)]

Not just a worldbuilding and writing project, but an entire world I've built inside my head; the apex of my desire and drive to _create_.

I can close my mind and walk through Ras' home in the woods; I can picture the view of the lake and the Winterblush Peaks from his kitchen window. I have written excerpts of mundane moments that have happened within it solely for the sake of being able to __live in this world, if only for a few moments__.
